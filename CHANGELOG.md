## [0.7.0] - 2025-10-26

### Added
- **Automatic Subscription Reconnection**: Client now automatically resubscribes to all active queries after network disconnections
  - `NetworkMonitor` using `Network.framework` detects network state changes (iOS 12.0+, macOS 10.14+)
  - Subscriptions are tracked internally and automatically reestablished on reconnection
  - Works seamlessly with WiFi â†” Cellular switches, airplane mode, and Mac laptop sleep/wake
  - Fixes infinite loading spinner issue when network connection is lost and restored
- **Manual Reconnection API**: New public `reconnect()` method for manual control
  - Useful for app lifecycle events (e.g., `applicationWillEnterForeground`)
  - Allows custom network detection logic
  - Helpful for testing reconnection behavior
- Comprehensive tests for reconnection scenarios

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Subscriptions no longer hang after network disconnection and reconnection
  - Previously subscriptions would show infinite loading spinner after Mac sleep/wake
  - Previously subscriptions would not update after WiFi disconnect/reconnect
  - Network monitoring now correctly triggers resubscription
- Subscription cleanup now properly removes canceled subscriptions from tracking

### Technical Details
- `ConvexClient` now tracks all active subscriptions internally
- `NetworkMonitor` class monitors network path changes via `NWPathMonitor`
- Automatic resubscription happens on network state transition from disconnected to connected
- Weak references to subscription adapters prevent memory leaks
- Thread-safe subscription tracking with `NSLock`

## [0.6.0] - 2025-10-25

### Added
- **Automatic JWT Token Refresh**: `ConvexClientWithAuth` now automatically refreshes JWT tokens before they expire
  - `TokenRefreshManager` monitors token expiration and refreshes 60 seconds before expiry
  - Proactive approach prevents authentication errors in long-running apps
  - Uses reliable Timer-based scheduling (fixes iOS Simulator Task.sleep issues)
- **AuthProviderError** enum for standardized authentication errors
  - `refreshNotSupported` - provider doesn't support token refresh (default)
  - `tokenExpired` - token has expired and cannot be refreshed
  - `refreshFailed(Error)` - token refresh failed with underlying error
- **Default implementation** for `AuthProvider.refreshToken(from:)`
  - Non-breaking change - existing providers continue to work
  - Override to enable automatic token refresh for your provider
  - See documentation for implementation examples

### Changed
- `AuthProvider` protocol now includes `refreshToken(from:)` method
  - Default implementation throws `AuthProviderError.refreshNotSupported`
  - Non-breaking: providers without refresh support continue to work normally
  - Providers can opt-in to automatic refresh by implementing this method

### Fixed
- Token expiration causing unexpected logouts in long-running apps
- iOS Simulator reliability issues with long-duration Task.sleep
- Users no longer need to re-authenticate after token expiry

### Migration Guide

**No changes required** for existing `AuthProvider` implementations. Apps will continue to work as before.

To enable automatic token refresh, implement the `refreshToken(from:)` method:

```swift
extension MyAuthProvider {
  public func refreshToken(from authResult: Credentials) async throws -> Credentials {
    // Call your refresh endpoint
    guard let refreshToken = authResult.refreshToken else {
      throw AuthProviderError.tokenExpired
    }
    return try await myAPI.refreshToken(refreshToken)
  }
}
```
